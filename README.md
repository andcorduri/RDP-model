These Mathematica Notebooks were used to perform calculations for the paper:

"Equibiaxial elongation of entangled polyisobutylene melts: Experiments and theoretical predictions"

Authors: Seyed Mahmoud Arzideh, Andrés Córdoba, Jeffrey G. Ethier, Jay D. Schieber, and David C. Venerus

The paper was submitted for publication in the Journal of Rheology on 21-Dec-2023

The Notebooks solve the Rolie-Double-Poly (RDP) model [Boudara et. al., J. Rheol. 63 (1), 71-91] and calculate the entropy generation rate using the method of Schieber and Córdoba [Phys. Fluids 33 (8)].
